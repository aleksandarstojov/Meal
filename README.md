# Meal

The project structure could have been better organized and named.
There are files left in the project unused, code that is commented out, 
Some classes share the same file
Optionals could have been handled closer to the initial API call or handled instead of passing down to each view
Decoding in network layer could be more scalable with codingKeys and decodeIfPresent it will also allow to give the properties better names
loading and error states are not always handled
Add unit test
